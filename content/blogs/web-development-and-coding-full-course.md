**What is Javascript?**

JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved.

**What are you going to work on?**

In this course, we will cover six big topic groups. Every section contains a lot of assignments and code exercises.

The final project is a web application to display products for users to buy. For the entire course length, you will work on one application. We will start simple with console application and finish with React JS, an excellent styled application.

You will see how your application evolves, what techniques are required, and how everything connects in the end. You will get a complete understanding of the programming process.

**1\. JS Basics**

In this part, you will learn the basics in the Javascript programming language, but you will also get programmatic thinking that can help you start with any programming language.

The focus of this section is to think like the programmers and not repeat code without understanding.

Some of the topics from this section are:

*   computing history, variables, primitive types, functions, parameters, 
*   objects, arrays, conditionals, logical operators, classes, inheritance, prototypes
*   debugging, scope, call stack

**2\. HTML Basics**

This part of the course covers the core part of HTML. You will learn and understand how to structurize HTML documents. 

This part covers:

*   dom (document object model), document object,
*   elements + functions

**3\. CSS Basics**

To make the website look professional, you need to apply "style." In this section, you will learn how to use stylings effectively.

You will now learn how to use the two most used stylings: flex and grid.

**4\. HTML + JS**

The central part of modern frameworks like Angular, Vue, or React is to create seamless interaction of JS with HTML without you even noticing.

This part will teach you how things work behind the scene. You will use javascript to render HTML elements dynamically.

The main topics of this section are:

*   HTML nodes, dynamic elements

*   "mini" JS framework, modularity, 

*   ES and Common modules

**5\. Web server  + Webpack**

In this part, we will first cover communication on the internet from the perspective of client->server. You will learn how your computer requests the remote server to display any website on the internet.

Then we will create our custom Web Server, which will serve our HTML project, which we created in the sections before.

Later in the section, we will dive into Webpack. Webpack is a  bundler, and we will use it to bundle our javascript code together. You will learn how to write a javascript, which was impossible to write before.

*   client->sever, servers
*   Node JS, Webpack, 

**6. React JS**

The final part of this course will cover React JS library. You will learn to use React JS to create web applications with ease. You will create a final version of your web app. In the end, everything will connect, and you will understand how React JS works.

*   React JS
*   Hooks, State
*   Reactivity

It will be a long journey, but you will become developers in the end.
